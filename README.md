# SenKan 戦艦

Battleship game but it's customizable. Currently only the Console App works with a dummy game loaded in. The goal is for it to be a locally hosted game running with .NET Web API. The super goal is to use Authentication and make it available everywhere but man is .NET Authentication weird.

## Instructions

Go to `SenKanConsole/` and execute `dotnet run`. That's it, you will have a dummy game ready for you to test out the game mechanics.
